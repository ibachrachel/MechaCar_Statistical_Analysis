# Module 15 Challenge

## Overview: 

*Background*

Jeremy is the primary analytic for AutosRUs and has been with the company for 10 years. The company's decision making process needs to be upgraded into the 21st century. Data analytics needs to be included when studying design for future product testing, study design, and other analysis for the manufacturing process. Jeremy and the rest of the Analytics team are using the statiscal language of R to work with summary statistics, visualization, and interpretations of test results. Critical thinking will definitely help the manufactuing process improve. 

*Purpose*

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

The following tasks will help the manufacting team make a decison going forward: 

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
